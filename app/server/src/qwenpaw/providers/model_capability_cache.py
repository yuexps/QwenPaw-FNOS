"""Learned model capability cache.

When the system discovers model capabilities through trial-and-error
(e.g. a model requires ``reasoning_content`` on every assistant message,
or rejects multimodal input despite being marked as supporting it),
those findings are cached here by ``provider_id:model_name`` key.

This avoids repeated first-call failures when the same model is used
again after a model switch.  The cache is process-scoped (not persisted)
and deliberately conservative: entries are only written after a confirmed
failure-then-recovery cycle.

Entries expire after ``CAPABILITY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`` so that a stale
finding from a transient upstream issue does not permanently suppress
media input.  Setting the TTL to ``0`` (via
``QWENPAW_CAPABILITY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS``) disables expiry.

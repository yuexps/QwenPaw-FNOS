"""Async and atomic filesystem utilities.

Choose an API by the required filesystem semantics:

* Use :func:`read_text_async` or :func:`read_bytes_async` for standalone
  reads.
* Use :func:`append_text_async` when content must remain in the same file
  and replacing the whole file would be incorrect.
* Use the ``write_*_atomic_async`` functions when replacing durable state,
  configuration, JSON, or YAML. Readers observe either the old complete
  file or the new complete file.
* Hold :func:`get_path_lock` across a complete read-modify-write sequence,
  then use an atomic writer for the replacement.
* Use :func:`run_sync_io` only to adapt an already-composed legacy
  filesystem, subprocess, or network workflow when no semantic helper fits.

Async application code should not call ``asyncio.to_thread`` directly for
file I/O. The public async functions in this module own thread offloading.

QwenPaw's supported server topology uses one application worker and one
event loop. Consequently, :func:`get_path_lock` is sufficient for shared
file transactions and an OS-level lock such as ``flock`` is intentionally
not used. Revisit that decision only if multi-process writers are supported.
